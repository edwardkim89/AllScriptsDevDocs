In this case, the observation shall be matched to a patient through some context/channel matching technique, and at this point, the observation should be updated. If the target of the observation is different than the subject, the general extension observation-focal-subject. may be used.

<td>0..1</td>
<td>Information determined as a result of making the observation, if the information has a simple value. Choice of: Quantity, CodeableConcept, string, Range, Ratio, SampledData, Attachment, time, dateTime, Period. Normally, an observation will have either a value or a set of related observations. A few observations (e.g. Apgar score) may have both a value and related observations (for an Apgar score, the observations from which the measure is derived). If a value is present, the datatype for this element should be determined by Observation.code. A CodeableConcept with just a text would be used instead of a string if the field was usually coded, or if the type associated with the Observation.code defines a coded value. For boolean values use valueCodeableConcept and select codes from <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v2-0136">http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v2-0136</a> (These “yes/no” concepts can be mapped to the display name “true/false” or other mutually exclusive terms that may be needed”). The element, Observation.value[x], has a variable name depending on the type as follows: valueQuantity, valueCodeableConcept, valueRatio, valueChoice, valuePeriod, valueSampleData, or valueString (The name format is “‘value’ + the type name” with a capital on the first letter of the type).</td>

<td>– component.valueQuantity</td>
<td>Quantity</td>
<td>0..1</td>
<td>Actual component result or a measured amount (or an amount that can potentially be measured). The value contains the numerical value of the quantity, including an implicit precision. If no comparator is specified, the value is a point value (i.e. ‘=’). The comparator element can never be ignored.</td>

<td>– component.valueRange</td>
<td>Hl7.Fhir.Model.Range</td>
<td>0..1</td>
<td>Set of ordered Quantity values defined by a low and high limit. A Range specifies a set of possible values; usually, one value from the range applies (e.g. “give the patient between 2 and 4 tablets”). Ranges are typically used in instructions. The unit and code/system elements of the low or high elements shall match. If the low or high elements are missing, the meaning is that the low or high boundaries are not known and therefore neither is the complete range. The low and the high values are inclusive, and are assumed to have arbitrarily high precision; e.g. the range 1.5 to 2.5 includes 1.50, and 2.50 but not 1.49 or 2.51.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>– component.valueRatio</td>
<td>Hl7.Fhir.Model.Ratio</td>
<td>0..1</td>
<td>Relationship between two Quantity values expressed as a numerator and a denominator. Common factors in the numerator and denominator are not automatically cancelled out. The Ratio data type is used for titers (e.g. “1:128”) and other quantities produced by laboratories that truly represent ratios. Ratios are not simply “structured numbers” - for example blood pressure measurements (e.g. “120/60”) are not ratios. In addition, ratios are used where common factors in the numerator and denominator do not cancel out. A proper ratio has both a numerator and a denominator; however these are not mandatory in order to allow an invalid ratio with an extension with further information.</td>

<tr>
<td>– component.valueSampledData</td>
<td>Hl7.Fhir.Model.SampledData</td>
<td>0..1</td>
<td>Data that comes from a series of measurements taken by a device, with upper and lower limits. There may be more than one dimension in the data. A SampledData provides a concise way to handle the data produced by devices that sample a physical particular state at a high frequency. A typical use for this is for the output of an ECG or EKG device.</td>

<td>Hl7.Fhir.Model.Attachment</td>

<td>Date, date-time or partial date (e.g. just year or year + month) as used in human communication. If hours and minutes are specified, a time zone shall be populated. Seconds must be provided due to schema type constraints but may be zero-filled and may be ignored. Dates shall be valid dates. The time “24:00” is not allowed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>– component.valuePeriod</td>
<td><a href="https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#Period" target="_blank">Period</a></td>
<td>0..1</td>
<td>Time period defined by a start and end date/time. A period specifies a range of times. The context of use will specify whether the entire range applies (e.g. “the patient was an inpatient of the hospital for this time range”) or one value from the period applies (e.g. “give to the patient between 2 and 4 pm on 24-Jun 2013”). If the start element is missing, the start of the period is not known. If the end element is missing, it means that the period is ongoing, or the start may be in the past, and the end date in the future, which means that period is expected/planned to end at the specified time. The end value includes any matching date/time. For example, the period 2011-05-23 to 2011-05-27 includes all the times from the start of the 23rd May through to the end of the 27th of May.</td>

<td>– component.referenceRange</td>
<td></td>
<td>0..*</td>
<td>Guidance on how to interpret the value by comparison to a normal or recommended range. Knowing what values are considered “normal” can help evaluate the significance of a particular result. Need to be able to provide multiple reference ranges for different contexts. Most observations only have one generic reference range. Systems MAY choose to restrict to only supplying the relevant reference range based on knowledge about the patient (e.g. specific to the patient’s age, gender, weight and other factors), but this may not be possible or appropriate. Whenever more than one reference range is supplied, the differences between them SHOULD be provided in the reference range and/or age properties.</td>
