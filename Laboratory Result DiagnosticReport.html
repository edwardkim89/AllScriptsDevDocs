<td>Status of the diagnostic report as a whole. Diagnostic services routinely issue provisional/incomplete reports, and sometimes withdraw previously released reports. This is labeled as “Is Modifier” because applications need to take appropriate action if a report is withdrawn. The codes shall be taken from the DiagnosticReportStatus value set, which includes the following statuses: Registered, Partial, Final, Corrected, Appended, Cancelled, and Entered-in-Error.

<td>Code that classifies the clinical discipline, department, or diagnostic service that created the report. For example, cardiology, biochemistry, hematology, or MRI. This is used for searching, sorting, and displaying purposes. The level of granularity is defined by the category concepts in the DiagnosticServiceSectionCodes value set. More filtering is performed using the metadata and/or terminology hierarchy in DiagnosticReport.code. Alternate names: Department, Sub-department, service, discipline.  Example codes include: AU- Audiology, CH- Chemistry, MB- Microbiology, and HM- Hematology.

The typical patterns for codes are: 1) a LOINC code either as a translation from a “local” code or as a primary code, 2) a local code only if no suitable LOINC exists, or 3) both the local and the LOINC translation. Systems shall be capable of sending the local code if one exists. The codes shall be taken from US Laboratory Observation Profile Observation Name Codes. Other codes may be used where these codes are not suitable. This value set has more than 1000 codes.
